This is a day planner. It's used to keep track of events that you have planned out for the day. When you open your planner,
the time blocks will be color coded based off the current hour. If the hour has passed, the time block will be grey. The current
hour will be red and the future hours will be green. The code has saved the events to localStorage making it possible for the
planner to hold the events in the text area even after the page has been refreshed.
